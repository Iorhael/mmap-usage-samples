# mmap-usage-samples
Several examples implemented in C demonstrating work with [`mmap()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html).

> :bulb: **Hint**: To see an example, run the corresponding shell script (exception is `line_by_line_reading.c`).
> If you want to get `mmap_vs_read_stats` don't forget to add you own big file.
